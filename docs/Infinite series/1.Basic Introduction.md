Let

$$
p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}C_ix^i
$$

with $C_i\in\mathbb{R}, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. Let

$$
p_j(x)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty C_{i,j}x^i,
$$

the $j$th composition of $p$. We know that $p_j$ exists because functions stay analytic under composition. Even if the original function did not converge, $p_j$ still has a meaning as a formal serie.
Some trivial properties:
+ $p_0(x)=x$
+ $p_1(x)=p(x)$
The case with $C_0\ne 0$ is complicated as all coeficient have an impact on all coeficients. We will thus focus on the case $C_0=0$
